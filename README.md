<h1> Object Oriented Database  </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project I have created uses Object Oriented Programming , to act as a database of people personal information. This program includes information about the following :<br>
1.First Name<br>
2. Surname<br>
3. Grade<br>
4. Bank<br>
5.Money <br><br>

The code also allows to change and update the current details if needeed , and saves them on the system , So that whenever next logged in, it will be the newly updated details of each student.

There was many other ways on creating a database that stores information , However I chose to use OBJ , as it is more clean code and more structured. Also allows me to use repetitive code for different objects and entities.
